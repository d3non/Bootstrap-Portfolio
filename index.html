                            <p>Passionate about music and technology, I dedicated myself mainly to the management of software development projects, 
                            and it always helped me to learn new ways to create web pages, this Bootcamp Yes course represents a great challenge. 
                            After all in technology you always have to keep updated, renew or die!
                            </p>

                            <p>I've also worked in the musical environment, but it's not like I've played music, but I've had a sound and I like to mix, 
                            has put several events with an excellent musical taste, it's been like that and they've all been finished really excited.
                            I love sports too, so i believe that i have a really balanced life, i enjoy my work, have time to listen to music and eventually
                            going on vacation to discover new countries and cultures.
